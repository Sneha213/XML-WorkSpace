- the url-mapping element must have both 'url' and 'currentpage' attributes

- the url-mapping element must have a request-handler child element (only 1)

- the request-handler element must have command-mapping elements

- the command-mapping element must have 'command' attribute.

- the 'target-page' attribute is optional.
